# ImageJ Plugin: split_multipoints.ijm

### Purpose
**split_multipoints.ijm** splits 6D-images with multiple XY position into individual TIFF files/stacks. This code is written for Nikon ND2 files generated from Nikon spinning disk confocal microscope, so further tests are required for other 6D format. Scripts are modified from the example code on Bio-Formats documentation web page.

### Installation
To run the script,
1. copy and paste the script in the ImageJ/Fiji built-in editor, then hit *RUN*
2. run code through **Plugins** -> **Macros** -> **Run...**
3. save the .ijm file into "ImageJ/plugins" or "Fiji/plugins" folder, then restart the application. **split_multipoints.ijm** will become one of the function under the **Plugins** menu.
